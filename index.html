      <p>
        <span class="first-letter">I</span>taly is a country consisting of a peninsula delimited by
        the Alps and several islands surrounding it. Italy is located in the center of the
        Mediterranean Sea, in Southern Europe, and is also often considered part of Western Europe.
        A unitary parliamentary republic with Rome as its capital and largest city, the country
        covers a total area of 301,340 km2 (116,350 sq mi) and shares land borders with France,
        Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, and the enclaved microstates of Vatican City and San Marino.
        Italy has a territorial exclave in Switzerland (Campione) and a maritime exclave in Tunisian
        waters (Lampedusa). With around 60 million inhabitants, Italy is the third-most populous
        member state of the European Union, after Germany and France.

          <p>
            Cinque Terre is a coastal area within Liguria, in the northwest of Italy. It lies in the
            west of La Spezia Province, and comprises five villages: Monterosso al Mare, Vernazza,
            Corniglia, Manarola, and Riomaggiore. The coastline, the five villages, and the
            surrounding hillsides are all part of the Cinque Terre National Park, a UNESCO World
            Heritage Site. The Cinque Terre area is a popular tourist destination. Over the centuries,
            people have built terraces on the rugged, steep landscape right up to the cliffs that
            overlook the Ligurian Sea. Paths, trains, and boats connect the villages as cars can only
            reach them with great difficulty from the outside via narrow and precarious mountain
            roads.

  <h2>Venice</h2>
  <p>
    Venice is a city in northeastern Italy and the capital of the Veneto region. It is built
    on a group of 118 small islands that are separated by canals and linked by over 400
    bridges. The islands are in the shallow Venetian Lagoon, an enclosed bay lying between the
    mouths of the Po and the Piave rivers (more exactly between the Brenta and the Sile). In
    2020, 258,685 people resided in the Comune di Venezia, of whom around 55,000 live in the
    historical city of Venice (centro storico). Together with Padua and Treviso, the city is
    included in the Padua-Treviso-Venice Metropolitan Area (PATREVE), which is considered a
    statistical metropolitan area, with a total population of 2.6 million.

        <h2>volcanology</h2>
        <p>
          The country is situated at the meeting point of the Eurasian Plate and the African Plate,
          leading to considerable seismic and volcanic activity. There are 14 volcanoes in Italy,
          four of which are active: Etna, Stromboli, Vulcano and Vesuvius. The last is the only
          active volcano in mainland Europe and is most famous for the destruction of Pompeii and
          Herculanum in the eruption in 79 AD. Several islands and hills have been created by
          volcanic activity, and there is still a large active caldera, the Campi Flegrei north-west
          of Naples.
