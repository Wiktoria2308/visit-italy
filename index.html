      <p>
        <span class="first-letter">I</span>taly is a country consisting of a peninsula delimited by
        the Alps and several islands surrounding it. Italy is located in the center of the
        Mediterranean Sea, in Southern Europe, and is also often considered part of Western Europe.
        A unitary parliamentary republic with Rome as its capital and largest city, the country
        covers a total area of 301,340 km2 (116,350 sq mi) and shares land borders with France,
        Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, and the enclaved microstates of Vatican City and San Marino.
        Italy has a territorial exclave in Switzerland (Campione) and a maritime exclave in Tunisian
        waters (Lampedusa). With around 60 million inhabitants, Italy is the third-most populous
        member state of the European Union, after Germany and France.

            Cinque Terre is a coastal area within Liguria, in the northwest of Italy. It lies in the
            west of La Spezia Province, and comprises five villages: Monterosso al Mare, Vernazza,
            Corniglia, Manarola, and Riomaggiore. The coastline, the five villages, and the
            surrounding hillsides are all part of the Cinque Terre National Park, a UNESCO World
            Heritage Site. The Cinque Terre area is a popular tourist destination. Over the
            centuries, people have built terraces on the rugged, steep landscape right up to the
            cliffs that overlook the Ligurian Sea. Paths, trains, and boats connect the villages as
            cars can only reach them with great difficulty from the outside via narrow and
            precarious mountain roads.

            Venice is a city in northeastern Italy and the capital of the Veneto region. It is built
            on a group of 118 small islands that are separated by canals and linked by over 400
            bridges. The islands are in the shallow Venetian Lagoon, an enclosed bay lying between
            the mouths of the Po and the Piave rivers (more exactly between the Brenta and the
            Sile). In 2020, 258,685 people resided in the Comune di Venezia, of whom around 55,000
            live in the historical city of Venice (centro storico). Together with Padua and Treviso,
            the city is included in the Padua-Treviso-Venice Metropolitan Area (PATREVE), which is
            considered a statistical metropolitan area, with a total population of 2.6 million.

        <h2>volcanology</h2>
        <p>
          The country is situated at the meeting point of the Eurasian Plate and the African Plate,
          leading to considerable seismic and volcanic activity. There are 14 volcanoes in Italy,
          four of which are active: Etna, Stromboli, Vulcano and Vesuvius. The last is the only
          active volcano in mainland Europe and is most famous for the destruction of Pompeii and
          Herculanum in the eruption in 79 AD. Several islands and hills have been created by
          volcanic activity, and there is still a large active caldera, the Campi Flegrei north-west
          of Naples.

      <p><span class="first-letter">R</span>ome (Italian and Latin: Roma [ˈroːma] is the capital city of Italy. It is also the capital of the Lazio region, the centre of the Metropolitan City of Rome, and a special comune named Comune di Roma Capitale. With 2,860,009 residents in 1,285 km2 (496.1 sq mi), Rome is the country's most populated comune and the third most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome, with a population of 4,355,725 residents, is the most populous metropolitan city in Italy. Its metropolitan area is the third-most populous within Italy. Rome is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of the Tiber. Vatican City (the smallest country in the world) is an independent country inside the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city; for this reason, Rome has sometimes been described as the capital of two states. Rome is often referred to as the City of Seven Hills due to its geographic location and also the "Eternal City."</p>

    <h2>Vatican City</h2>
    <p>Vatican City, officially the Vatican City State is an independent city state and enclave located within Rome. The Vatican City State, also known simply as the Vatican, became independent from Italy with the Lateran Treaty (1929), and it is a distinct territory under "full ownership, exclusive dominion, and sovereign authority and jurisdiction" of the Holy See, itself a sovereign entity of international law, which maintains the city state's temporal, diplomatic, and spiritual independence. With an area of 49 hectares and a population of about 825, it is the smallest state in the world by both area and population. As governed by the Holy See, the Vatican City State is an ecclesiastical or sacerdotal-monarchical state (a type of theocracy) ruled by the pope who is the bishop of Rome and head of the Catholic Church. The highest state functionaries are all Catholic clergy of various national origins. After the Avignon Papacy (1309–1437), the popes have mainly resided at the Apostolic Palace within what is now Vatican City, although at times residing instead in the Quirinal Palace in Rome or elsewhere.</p>
